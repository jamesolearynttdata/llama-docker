```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the LLaMA repository and install dependencies
COPY llama/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the LLaMA model weights
COPY llama/model_weights.pth .

# Run the script that trains and fine-tunes the model
CMD ["python", "train_and_finetune.py"]
```
This `Dockerfile` uses a Python 3.9 image as the base, installs the required 
dependencies using pip, copies my model weights, and sets the command to run the 
training and fine-tuning script.

**Step 3: Create a requirements.txt file**

Create a new file named `requirements.txt` in the root directory of your project. This
file should include the necessary dependencies for LLaMA:
```txt
transformers==4.10.0
torch==1.12.0
numpy==1.21.0
```
